Additional Notes on Simulating Lid driven cavity (LDC) using Lattice Boltzmann methods.

- A comaprative study was done for Re 1000 and 400.
- Lattice model parameters (velocity, pressure, density etc..) are all scaled to achieve the required Reynolds numbers.
- Simulating LDC at higher Reynolds numbers using Bounce-back BCs (Vs Zou-He) proved to be more stable.
- Due to this reason running models using ZouHe for the same time was not possible as the simulation time increased significantly.
- To achieve stability it seems that it necessary to keep the flow speed < 0.33 (Scaled Mach number).
- The viscosity is another parameter that may be tweaked by adjusting the relaxation time.
- However these parameters are limited as when the prescribed limits are exceeded on one end the simulations loose stability, while 
  if the parameters are set to exceed the other end, the simulation time increases (due to corresponding grid size increment).

- The Lid-Driven cavity results were compared (As seen in images), for higher reynolds numbers the vorticity pattern is more defined 
  than for lower Re numbers. This seems to be a reasonable observation, but does not answer if the results are accurate.
  
Further work: 
-Analytical verification of the results needed. (required to go through the theory in detail and provide a comparison)
-C++ simulations will need to be considered to get over simulation time issues. (Limited personal experience suggests Python simulations are 
 reasonable for lattice size of 200x200 or less for D2Q9 models).
