The laminar- turbulance region for within a pipe is said to be;

Re < ~2000 laminar
Re > 2000 turbulent.

The entrance length (Lh) for fully developed flow;

(Lh/D) = 0.05*Re (for laminar flow).

for the Poisuille flow profile with Bounce-back example the fully developed flow was estimated to 
occur at a time step 10 times less than on the actual run (eg: estimated for 85th timestep, but occurs
close to the 850 timestep). This would need to be further understood.
